# Django Blog Post Management
This Django project exemplifies the development of a sophisticated BlogPost model integrated with signals, showcasing advanced functionalities. Below, I outline the primary components and features encapsulated in the project:

BlogPost Model
Attributes:

title: CharField with a maximum length of 120 characters.
slug: SlugField for constructing SEO-friendly URLs, automatically generated from the title.
liked: Many-to-Many relationship with the User model, representing users who have liked the blog post.
notify_users: BooleanField indicating whether to notify users about the blog post.
notify_users_timestamp: DateTimeField capturing the timestamp when users are notified.
active: BooleanField denoting the status of the blog post.
Methods:

__str__: Provides a human-readable representation of the blog post, returning its title.
Signals
blog_post_pre_save
Objective: Executed before persisting a BlogPost instance to the database.
Functionality: Dynamically generates a slug from the title if not explicitly provided and logs information about the instance.
blog_post_post_save
Objective: Executed after successfully saving a BlogPost instance to the database.
Functionality: If notify_users is True, logs a notification message and updates related fields accordingly.
blog_post_pre_delete
Objective: Executed before initiating the removal of a BlogPost instance.
Functionality: Logs a message indicating the impending removal of a specific instance.
blog_post_post_delete

blog_post_liked_changed
Objective: Executed when modifications are made to the "liked" field of BlogPost (additions or removals).
Functionality: Logs messages based on the specific action, such as notifying when users are added.
These signals serve as pivotal hooks for the execution of custom logic at different phases of the BlogPost lifecycle.

This project serves as an advanced reference, providing insights into efficient and elegant ways of implementing similar functionalities in complex Django applications.
